class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, numbers: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        left = 0  #left starts at the beginning of the list.
        right = len(numbers) - 1   #right starts at the end of the list.

        while left < right:   #We keep checking pairs until the two pointers meet.
            total = numbers[left] + numbers[right]    #We add the numbers at left and right.

            if total == target:      
                return [left + 1, right + 1]
            elif total > target:
                right -= 1
            else:
                left += 1



Case:
Case 1: Found the Target
if total == target:
    return [left + 1, right + 1]

If the sum equals the target → we found the answer.

We return left + 1 and right + 1.

⚠ Why +1?
Because the problem expects 1-based indexing, not Python’s 0-based indexing.

🔽 Case 2: Sum is Too Big
elif total > target:
    right -= 1

If the sum is greater than target,

We move the right pointer one step left.

This makes the sum smaller.

🔼 Case 3: Sum is Too Small
else:
    left += 1

If the sum is smaller than target,

We move the left pointer one step right.

This makes the sum bigger.
